# RaytracingWithScalaJS
This is the raytracer found at the scala-js fiddle (http://www.scala-js-fiddle.com/gist/9443f8e0ecc68d1058ad/RayTracer.scala),
extracted to a Javascript application running in a browser without the fiddle.

Most likely, it has originally been written by Li Haoyi (https://github.com/lihaoyi/workbench-example-app/blob/ray-tracer/src/main/scala/example/ScalaJSExample.scala).

# Usage
In case you haven't installed sbt yet, follow step 0 and step 1 of http://www.scala-js.org/doc/tutorial.html.
Clone the GitHub repo, open the cmd windows and cd to the project folder. Type "sbt". After a while, a prompt 
shows. Type "fastObtJS".
Now open demo.html in your browser. And watch how the small image is drawn.
